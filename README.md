# HR-Attrition-Dashboard
Predict &amp; Visualize Employee Resignation Risk using Python &amp; Power BI
💼 HR Analytics – Employee Resignation Predictor & Dashboard
This end-to-end project helps HR teams understand and reduce employee attrition using machine learning and business intelligence. It includes:

✅ A predictive model (Random Forest Classifier)

📊 An interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights

Built as part of my Data Science & Business Analyst portfolio to demonstrate real-world application of data-driven decision-making.

🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on HR attrition — the voluntary resignation of employees — and provides data-driven tools to analyze trends, uncover risks, and support retention strategy.

It combines two domains:

🔍 Data Science	📊 Business Intelligence
Preprocessing, EDA, feature selection	KPI cards, bar charts, slicers
Random Forest Classifier	Resignation rate calculation (DAX)
Accuracy, confusion matrix, evaluation	Drill-downs by department, gender

🎯 Objectives
Predict whether an employee is likely to resign

Identify departments with high attrition

Analyze income, education, and job roles related to resignation

Build an HR dashboard that supports strategic decisions

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn)

Power BI (DAX, cards, slicers, formatting)

Streamlit (optional - for ML model interface)

GitHub (project management & version control)

📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
📌 KPI Cards:

Total Employees

Resigned Employees

Resignation Rate (%)

📈 Charts:

Attrition by Department

Monthly Income vs Attrition

Attrition split (Pie / Donut)

Gender & Job Role filters

🎛 Slicers:

Filter by Department, Gender, Education, Job Role

🎨 Visual Design:

Red = Resigned, Green/Blue = Retained

Clean layout with executive summary look

Preview:


📉 Machine Learning Model
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

Accuracy: 85%+ on test data

Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall

Implemented in Jupyter / Colab

🧪 Python Code includes:

Preprocessing (Label Encoding, Scaling)

Model training and evaluation

Output visualization

🔍 Key Insights Found
R&D department had the highest attrition

Employees with low monthly income were more likely to resign

Males had slightly higher attrition than females

Job Role and Age also influenced attrition

📌 What I Learned
Creating DAX Measures for business KPIs

Designing clean, interactive dashboards

Merging ML outputs into BI visuals

Communicating technical insights visually

📂 How to Use
Clone/download this repo

Open Power BI file (.pbix)

Review and interact with slicers & visuals

Optional: Use Python code to re-train or update model
